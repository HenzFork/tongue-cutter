This program is meant to be left running in the background as you play Elden Ring. Literally just a timer that sometimes turns taunter's tongue on and off.

The timer waits for 10 minutes, then rolls a dice every 40 seconds, with a 15% chance of activating a voice message, and then activates taunter's tongue. After that, it deactivates taunter's tongue, and goes back to counting to 10 minutes (peace mode.)

The taunter's tongue item needs to be placed within the item hotkeys pouch (the ones on the top right when you press the START button ingame), by default, the code activates the item on the LEFT button. You can change it to RIGHT, UP, or DOWN from within the config.txt file.

Make sure that the "Furlcalling finger remedy" item is active at all times, which enables online play in the game.

All the timers, chances of activation, and time intervals between activation attempts can be set to any number you like within the config.txt file. The default is 10 minutes of peace time, followed by 40 seconds in between attempts to activate (at 15% chance), followed by 60 seconds in between attempts to deactivate (at 95% chance.)

Meaning you could be prompted to enable taunter's tongue as soon as 10 minutes 40 seconds, or it could be over half an hour without getting invaded once.

There is a small chance that you wouldn't be prompted to deactivate the taunter's tongue (5%) for more than a couple of minutes, so there is always a chance of multiple invaders showing up. You can disable this by setting the "peace_chance" to = 1 within the config.txt file.

The notification sounds can be changed by replacing the activate.mp3 or deactivate.mp3 files with whatever sound you prefer. Just make sure that they are correctly named "activate.mp3" and "deactivate.mp3" and that they are within the same folder as the program.

The goal is to make being invaded as a solo player in Elden Ring feel as organic as previous FromSoftware games. Having the taunter's tongue active all the time is too stressful, since there is no time in between invasions.
